# E7GZLY

-	People go to organizations such as banks, telecommunication companies, repair centers, governmental agencies to get a service.
-	Usually, there are a lot of people want to get the same service so they wait in a queue to be served.
-	This queue can lead to waiting time that reaches over 60 to 120 minutes or even more

-	Our mission is to reduce waiting time to the minimum!
-	We can achieve this mission by making a website that you can reserve your ticket through it and go to the facility you want to be served on time instead of going there and reserve a ticket and wait until your ticket is shown to be served 

-	Through E7GZLY, you can register then login into your account, choose the category of organizations you want, choose the organization itself, choose a branch if any, choose a service inside that branch and also you can view the current waiting number and estimated time to be served before you can reserve your ticket
-	Also, you can track your ticket continuously to check how much estimated time you have before your ticket to be served
